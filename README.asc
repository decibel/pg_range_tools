= Range Tools for Postgres
This extension creates some tools for working with range types in Postgres.

== Current Status

Existing function APIs should be stable. Let me know what other tools you could use!

== Supported Versions
Works on Postgres 9.5 and above. Currently restricted because 9.5 is the version that introduced the timestamp creation functions.

== Functions
=== `range_from_array()`
These functions will create a range type that spans all the values in the input array.

When the extention is installed, it will create types for all the range types that are in pg_catalog. You can create additional range_from_array() functions by calling `_range_from_array__create(range_type)`.

== Views
=== range_types
This view denormalizes most of the information about all of the range types in the system. It is based on the `pg_range` catalog table.
